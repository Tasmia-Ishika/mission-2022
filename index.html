                <h1 class="high">Stay Focused on</h1>

            <p> Being focused on a specific goal is really necessary for an individual.Without being focused a person
                can
                never
                achieve a certain destination.To become successful a person should must set a target for themselves.They
                have
                to follow every step of their target accordingly with their 100% focus. But if we don't chase our
                targets we
                will never push ourself to become the one who we want to be!! That's why I have already set my targets
                to
                achieve my goals. I believe I can become a Web Developer but I need to push myself very hard to become
                one.I
                need to try my 100% to become something I've dreamed of. So I've already started my journey as beginner
                on
                web developing field since 1st January 2022. My journey may last this whole year that's why it is
                "Mission
                2022". By 2023 I might become a Junior Web developer if I dedicate myself towards my goal but it will
                not end there. I will set more goals onwards because "Learning Has No Age".

        </div>
        <div class="flexible">

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>Mission should be accomplished within deadline. Tendecy is the core component to complete any
                    challenges in life. Those who doesn't pay any sincerity towards their tasks will eventually fail to
                    complete the mission. We always have to remember that Hardworking,Dedication and Sincerity is
                    Mandatory to accomplish your destination</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>Vision is mainly the perspectives of a person. Also prioritizing your learning. We should remember if
                    we don't help out ourselves, nobody will.Our life teaches us this everyday yet sometimes we don't
                    recognize it. So we have to learn our lessons from our very own life and we should start improving
                    ourself. </p>

                </div>
                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Well Goal is nothing but what we want to see in ourself.Also I can say "Self Grooming".If we work
                    hard enough we will eventually reach our goals. We will able to reach on a certain position where
                    you've dreamed yourself in. </p>
